Thank you for purchasing FPC Swimmer!

The main demo scenes are located inside FPCSwimmer/Core/Scenes:
- SimpleDemo (A very basic scene setup showcasing swimming only)
- SunMoonSkyDemo (Includes also Day and Night cycle + more sounds)
- SunMoonSkyHighDefinitionTerrainDemo (Includes a textured terrain)

Each scene showscases the FPC swimmer script to swim into Crest water systems,
day and night cycle controls, underwater particles, sound controls,
and flares for Sun and Moon lights.

I added a lot of comments inside the scripts to help you understand
all functions, and potentially support you to extend the Core
functionalities with what you need for your project.

The default color space is Linear, to provide more accurate and realistic
perception of the virtual scene. I suggest you to keep it Linear without
switching to gamma.

Feel free to provide constructive feedback on the Unity Asset Store to
help me improve this pack in time and continue offering you updates
with the new contents.

I hope you enjoy my efforts, and that you will create great experiences

INTRODUCTION
This project is based on the Crest water system, which offers a realistic representation of ocean and water systems in Unity. The FPCSwimmer script extends the functionalities offered by Crest, providing creators with the ability to swim in first person inside Crest water.
Furthermore, this pack offers realistic sound transition controls, underwater physics, splash and underwater particles, speed control for walk on land and swim on water, day & night cycle control, realistic illumination and reflections, stars particles, and simple lens flares for Sun and Moon.

Note: For best realistic results, Linear color space is recommended.
